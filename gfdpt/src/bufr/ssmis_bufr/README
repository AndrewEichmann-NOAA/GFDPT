Basically here is what you need to do in order to 
convert SSMIS BUFR to observed radiance files (FMSDR format) , and then run 
"colocNWP" and "fwd" on them to generate 
   1) intermediate colocated GFS file(EDR format) 
   2) final simulated radiance(FMSDR format)

# 1. Set up data location, where you want to save data (three of them)
./setupPath.sh

# 2. Create namelist files used by f90 executable files.
# Attention : 
#   GFS config files such as gfs_atm_list_*.config and gfs_sfc_list_*.config 
#   under "config" folder need to be MANUALLY EXAMINED to make sure that these 
#   GFS forecast files DO cover the entire observation data.
#
#
./generateConfig.sh  f18     

# 3. Run f90 executable files
./run_gdas.sh  f18
