GOES I-M Sounder has 4 detectors. Each of the detectors has its own 
characteristics, CRTM coefficients, numbers of good data, etc.  I've
coded the COAT/MIRS interface routines to be able to utilize each of the 
4 GOES detectors for each satellite.  We'll need to assess each detector
for each instrument independently within the COAT.  That means for
GOES 13 and 15 there will be 8 data assessment reports to analyze.  

For 2014/10/08 00z and 06z GDAS analysis observation BUFR data 
we obtain for G13, 15 (data from: ftp.ncep.noaa.gov:
/pub/data/nccf/com/gfs/prod/gdas.20141008/gdas1.t??z.goesfv.tm00.bufr_d):

These numbers do not include tests for: 
1.) tests for NSST -- not sure what this is (ocean analysis?): 
    foundation temperature, dt_warm at zob, 
    dt_cool at zob, and d(Tz)/d(Tr)), 
2.) thinning, 
3.) time window relative to analysis window
4.) ocean/land test (only ocean obs accepted) -- requires 
    deter_sfc module, and 
5.) ch8 quality predictors.

tests included:
0.) satid = g?? and detector='sndrd?',
1.) missing or bad values (ACAV) (ibfms -- BUFR function),
2.) number of averaged fov > 3,
3.) bad lat/lon,
4.) tb < tbmin or tb > tbmax (tbmin=50., tbmax=550.)

CRTM also has nominal coefficients for GOES 13, 15 (e.g., sndr_g13) but the 
GSI does not use these coefficients.  I've setup The MIRS libraries s.t. 
either the detector dependent coefficients or the nominal coefficients
can be selected using the MIRS sensor_id variables.

GOES I-M Imager IR channels have 5 detector arrays each with two sides.  For 
CRTM there are several sets of coefficients: 

imgrS1_g13,imgrS2_g13,imgrD1S1_g13,imgrD2S1_g13,imgrD1S2_g13,imgrD2S2_g13

I would assume that S1 corresponds to side 1 and S2 corresponds to side 2, 
but I am not sure what D1, D2 mean.  There are also nominal coefficient 
files for the imager on GOES 13, 15 (e.g., imgr_g13).  The GSI uses
these nominal coefficients.

I am coding the imager interfaces in COAT/MIRS to CRTM to use the same
coefficient files as the GSI; however, we might want to eventually use
the other coefficients if we see outliers in observations for different
channels in different places.
